Server-side markdown renderer, using hello-webpage

### 🤷‍♂️ How does it work?

hello-webpage templates use something called lws (local web server) to serve static files (e.g. stylesheets, html files, javascript files, images, basically anything that does not need to be rendered by a server).
lws also allows you to configure the webserver (like setting up a username/password, setting up logs, etc) using a javascript file. The way you can config lws to fit your needs.
You can also "trick" lws into running code that is not configuration (like rendering markdown, getting posts from GhostCMS, etc)

### ⚙ How does it render markdown/save it?

[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) renders the markdown and [fs (file system)](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) saves it.

### 🎨 What stylesheet does this use?

[github-markdown-css](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css)

### ⏱️ Can I use this to keep my app on 24/7?

No. As wh0 pointed out, Glitch will initially use lws to serve the files, then move it to S3 (apparently) which is why some static sites go to sleep.

### 💻 How do I get started?

1. [Remix this project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/hello-markdown)
2. Make some pages (markdown is obviously supported, they must end with .md). If you make a page called `contact.md`, the path would be `/contact`.
3. Run `refresh`. You have to run `refresh` to refresh lws because since hello-webpage is a static site, Glitch does monitor/reload lws.

### 👩‍🎨 How do I customize the layout?

The layout is stored in `layout.html`. The main content can be access by using the keyword: `{{ content }}` (sort of like nunjucks)
